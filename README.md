# CyberPatriot-Security-Tool
A tool developed in C# for fixing common security issues in a workplace environment.

This repo contains a console-based program for Ubuntu, as well as a GUI-based application for Windows environments.
Both applications attempt to automatically fix security issues, saving a significant amount of time with common issues.

Note that these tools have not been maintained for a while, and they are unlikely to recieve any future updates.
Although most features should remain intact, it is entirely possible that they may fail or even break OS installs with future competition images.
As such, use them at your own risk!

Feel free to modify these programs for your own personal use. Cyber security can be rapidly accelerated with the right tools, especially ones that you've created yourself.
